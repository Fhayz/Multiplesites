    <div class="Header">About Me</div><br>
    <div class="plenty">Before coming to Stanford, I spent two years as a programmer at Taligent (now part of IBM). At Taligent, I worked on Places for Project Teams, a groupware product designed to improve communication and coordination within small project teams. I was fortunate to work with the Places for Project Teams product throughout an entire software lifecycle-from initial product conception through the actual product launch. <br><br>
    I have a Ph.D. from the University of California, Irvine, where I specialized in Software Engineering. My dissertation was on process support for software engineering teams. I also have a masters degree from Irvine, with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence, and bachelors degrees in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering. <br><br> <br>
    At Irvine, I taught Introduction to Software Engineering, a sophomore core class, and Software Processes, a graduate seminar. I also worked as a peer academic advisor, a freshmen orientation advisor, and served on leadership for campus chapters of both Habitat for Humanity and InterVarsity Christian Fellowship.</div><br>

    <div style="text-align: left; font-size: 15px;">Are you thinking about trying <a href="youtube.com">rock climbing?</a>  Climbing is a fun and challenging sport that has a surge of popularity in recent years. Almost anyone can climb: you don't need a high level of strength or fitness to get started. Gear is available for men, women, and children of all shapes and sizes, and most gyms will allow children as young as three to climb. Climbing is not about brute force. Climbing more difficult routes does take some strength, mostly in your legs and hands, but it also takes skill and problem-solving ability. <br><br>
    Oh, and it is okay if you are afraid of heights. Really. Just keep your eyes on the wall. </div> <br>
